                <h2> Me, Myself &amp; I</h2>
                <p> Although I am studying mechatronics &amp; robotics, I began as a mechanical engineer. In the third year of my studies, I was able to choose a major, and I chose mechatronics &amp; robotics. In addition to my hobby, I enjoy front-end web development (hence the existence of this website 😉).</p>
                <p> ✨ 4th year mechatronics &amp; robotics student at the HvA ✨. In my free time I like to go bouldering and running (mostly 5 of 10km). 🏃‍💨 </p>
                <p> Currently I'm interested in 🦾robotics🦾 combined with 🧠computer vision / AI🧠.</p>
